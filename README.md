# Ripplr (Grails 3 Version)

Ripplr is a Twitter-like application based on the Hubub project that was used in the [Grails In Action](https://www.manning.com/books/grails-in-action-second-edition)
book published by Manning Publications.

I created it as I followed along in the book and later converted it into a Grails 3 project, but there is still a lot of work that could be done.

I'll get around to those updates at some point and highlight them via blog posts on my blog [http://joelforjava.co](http://joelforjava.co).
